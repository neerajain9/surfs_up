## Surfs-Up (Module 9 Challenge)

## Overview 
W. Avy wants to understand temperature trends before giving his blessings to the investment portfolio. He'd like to see the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, so that he can determine if the surf and ice-cream shop business is sustainable all year round. 

## Results
### [June Temperatures](https://github.com/neerajain9/surfs_up/blob/Data-Science/Resources/summary%20statistics%20for%20June.png)

1. There's a decent sample data points (1700).
1. The mean temperature for the month of june is 74.94 degrees; a good temperature to be at beach and enjoy ice cream. However, water temperature would be a bit colder than 74.94 degrees. It's a good idea to have wet-suits that surfers don't mind wearing one. Even without wet-suites the water temperature would be alright.
1. We notice historic min temperature has recorded to be 64 degrees. Now, you really need wet-suits but it still is a decent temperature to surf provided waves hit high horizons.
1. The historic max temperature has hit 85 degrees and that would be a real treat for anyone at the beach whether surfing or not. And, ice-cream is for everyone too.
1. The temperature overall between first and third quartile swings between 73 and 77 degrees. This is really a good range.

### [December Temperatures](https://github.com/neerajain9/surfs_up/blob/Data-Science/Resources/summary%20statistics%20for%20December.png)

1. There's a reasonable sample data points (1517).
1. The mean temperature for the month of December is 71.04 degrees; a good temperature to be at beach and enjoy ice cream. However, water temperature would be a bit colder than 71.04 degrees. The wet-suits would come in handy. Even without wet-suites the water temperature would be alright.
1. We notice historic min temperature has recorded to be 56 degrees. The water temperature would be colder than 56. Unless we see high waves, the surfers might not show up. Whereas, during high tides, surfers don't mind cold water temperatures.
1. The historic max temperature was recorded 83 degrees. The one at the beach couldn't ask for a better temperature than this especially this time of the year.
1. The temperature overall between first and third quartile swings between 69 and 74 degrees. This is really a good range and would attract surfers even this time around.

### Key differences between June and December

1. The minimum temperature has about 8 degrees difference from June to December.
1. The mean temperature in December is about 4 degrees cooler than June.
1. The mean temperatures (1st-3rd quartile) in December swings about 4 degrees cooler than June.

## Summary
It seems the temperature in Decemeber are not too far appart from temperatures in June. There's a four degree difference on an average at each data analyis pointer. Due to its consistancey, we could predict a reasonable behaviour of visitor/surfers.

In our opinion, this is a good business proposal and W. Avy should fund it. This business model will be making money round the year.

The histogram we generated suggests close to what we have analyzed.

Our suggestions, would be to consider some complimentary food/breverage offering in the month of Decemeber since it is going to be comparatively cooler during this time. Perhaps coffee and fritters might warm the srufers up after a funful wave ride in cold water. 

We added the analysis to see precipitation levels in June and December.

There isn't any noticable difference between the month of June and December. So, from rains perspective the weather is good in the area.
